Short scripts from a Russian course 'Основы программирования на Python' which
I took on Coursera in 12/2019-01/2020.

This is basic Python, but I'm quite proud of 'Week 9' which I've written
without any prior experience in writing Python classes. Also I thought it
would be funny to write OOP task in FP style, so I just went with it.

Little bit of cheating included:)
