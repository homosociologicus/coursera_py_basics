Short scripts from a Russian course 'Основы программирования на Python' (Python Programming Basics) made by NRU HSE, which I took on Coursera in 12/2019-01/2020.

This is basic Python, but I'm quite proud of the last week, which I wrote without any prior experience in creating Python classes at the time. Also I thought it would be funny to write OOP task in FP-ish style, so I just went with it.

Code quality is beginner level and I don't provide the tasks themselves, but if one struggles with this course and finds this, one may use it. I do, however, remind you that it is better to write your own code and debug it 100 times than to copy the solution.

Little bit of cheating included:)
